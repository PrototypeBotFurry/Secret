        <p>

           Being a programmer we all programmers do a lot of coding and work hard on our projects, during the process we come across loads of bugs and errors in program and sometimes no matter how hard we try yet the program does not works as expected.

            This is the time when we search on Google or other platforms yet does not come up with the best, so where is the problem? Yea it is in the way we ask/search.

        <p>

            2) <span>Steps:</span> Explain your code intelligibly.

        </p>

        <p>

            3) <span>Expected Result:</span> Explain your expected result with a real world example so that people can understand it in a better way.
